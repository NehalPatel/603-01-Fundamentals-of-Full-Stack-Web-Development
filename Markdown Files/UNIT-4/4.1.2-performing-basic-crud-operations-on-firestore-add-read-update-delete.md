## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic HTML structure

```html
<!-- Simple HTML structure for: Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Heading displays topic title -->
    <h1>Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)</h1>
    <!-- Content area -->
    <div id="app">Hello, world!</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Example 2: Basic CSS styling

```css
/* Center content and style heading */
body {
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  margin: 2rem;
}
#app {
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
h1 {
  color: #2b6cb0; /* blue */
}
```

### Example 3: Basic JavaScript logic

```javascript
// Log the topic and render simple text
const topic = 'Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)'; // topic name
console.log('Topic:', topic); // output topic

// Create and append an element to the page
function renderMessage(msg) {
  // Select container
  const el = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.getElementById('app') : null;
  // Render when in browser
  if (el) {
    const p = document.createElement('p'); // create paragraph
    p.textContent = msg; // set message
    el.appendChild(p); // append to app container
  } else {
    console.log('Rendered message:', msg); // fallback for Node.js
  }
}

renderMessage('Initialized Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete).');

// Expected output:
// In browser: a new <p> with text "Initialized Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)."
// In Node: 'Rendered message: Initialized Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete).'
```

## Implementation Guide

1. Review the topic requirements and prerequisites
2. Set up a minimal environment relevant to Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)
3. Implement a basic working example step-by-step
4. Test functionality and iterate on improvements
5. Document assumptions, decisions, and trade-offs
6. Reflect on performance, security, and maintainability

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping environment setup or version mismatches
- Poor separation of concerns in code structure
- Ignoring error handling and edge cases
- Missing validation or sanitization for inputs
- Not testing cross-browser or cross-platform behavior

## Lab Session Tips

- Build incrementally; validate after each change
- Use console logs or breakpoints for visibility
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Prefer configuration over hardcoding values
- Save working snapshots to revert easily

## Try It Yourself

1) Extend the basic example to add a new feature in Performing basic CRUD operations on Firestore (add, read, update, delete)
2) Introduce an intentional bug and fix it via tests
3) Refactor the example to improve readability and performance
