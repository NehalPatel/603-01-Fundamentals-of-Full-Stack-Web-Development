# Working with Forms and APIs

## Learning Objectives

- Parse URL-encoded and JSON bodies
- Handle form submissions and responses
- Connect Angular forms to backend endpoints

## Code Examples

### Express Body Parsing

```js
import express from 'express'
const app = express()
app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))
app.post('/contact', (req, res) => res.json(req.body))
app.listen(3000)
```

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise

- Create `/register` accepting `name,email,password` and return `201`

### Solution

```js
app.post('/register', (req, res) => res.status(201).json(req.body))
```

## Troubleshooting & Pitfalls

- Ensure correct `Content-Type` headers from frontend
- Use JSON for APIs; URL-encoded for simple forms

- Outcomes: Build confidence through working, testable snippets.

## Technical Definitions

- Term: Concise, topic-relevant definition
- Concept: Key idea underpinning this topic
- Pattern: Repeatable solution to a common problem

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Basic HTML structure

```html
<!-- Simple HTML structure for: Working with Forms and APIs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Working with Forms and APIs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Heading displays topic title -->
    <h1>Working with Forms and APIs</h1>
    <!-- Content area -->
    <div id="app">Hello, world!</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Example 2: Basic CSS styling

```css
/* Center content and style heading */
body {
  font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
  margin: 2rem;
}
#app {
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
h1 {
  color: #2b6cb0; /* blue */
}
```

### Example 3: Basic JavaScript logic

```javascript
// Log the topic and render simple text
const topic = 'Working with Forms and APIs'; // topic name
console.log('Topic:', topic); // output topic

// Create and append an element to the page
function renderMessage(msg) {
  // Select container
  const el = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.getElementById('app') : null;
  // Render when in browser
  if (el) {
    const p = document.createElement('p'); // create paragraph
    p.textContent = msg; // set message
    el.appendChild(p); // append to app container
  } else {
    console.log('Rendered message:', msg); // fallback for Node.js
  }
}

renderMessage('Initialized Working with Forms and APIs.');

// Expected output:
// In browser: a new <p> with text "Initialized Working with Forms and APIs."
// In Node: 'Rendered message: Initialized Working with Forms and APIs.'
```

## Implementation Guide

1. Review the topic requirements and prerequisites
2. Set up a minimal environment relevant to Working with Forms and APIs
3. Implement a basic working example step-by-step
4. Test functionality and iterate on improvements
5. Document assumptions, decisions, and trade-offs
6. Reflect on performance, security, and maintainability

## Common Pitfalls

- Skipping environment setup or version mismatches
- Poor separation of concerns in code structure
- Ignoring error handling and edge cases
- Missing validation or sanitization for inputs
- Not testing cross-browser or cross-platform behavior

## Lab Session Tips

- Build incrementally; validate after each change
- Use console logs or breakpoints for visibility
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Prefer configuration over hardcoding values
- Save working snapshots to revert easily

## Try It Yourself

1) Extend the basic example to add a new feature in Working with Forms and APIs
2) Introduce an intentional bug and fix it via tests
3) Refactor the example to improve readability and performance
